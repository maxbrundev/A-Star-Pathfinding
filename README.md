## A-Star-Pathfinding
Back to basics with a fun SFML project to do a little break from projects in progress, the idea is coming from a video showing some animated algorithms debug visualization

⚠️ This project has been done during a long weekend for fun, many improvements Framework side are necessary to clean the implementation, but it was not the aim of this project. A better SFML Framework will be shared and used in this project when I will come back to some SFML projects. ⚠️
